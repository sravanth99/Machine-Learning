It is from the family of greedy search algorithm. It is useful to choose the most relevant feature that contribute to the model.
Feature combinations are model specific ( one set of feature might perform better on one model than other).
Cuurently sklearn doesn't have sbs implementation, so i think it would be helpful to implement sbs from scratch in python
